- 👋 Hi, I’m @CB2022
- 👀 I've previously worked in JS for APCS, C++ for robotics, Python for a datascience course, React for a few hackathons, and Arduino for personal projects.
- 🌱 I’m taking this class because I really enjoyed APCS and would love to learn as much about CS before college. I'd like to continue to purse CS and feel that this course is a good way to determine what exaclty I'm interested in within the field. I also really enjoy learning about the social implications of CS, AI, and DS. 
- 💞️ Outside of CS, I'm interested in **rehabilitative robotics**, **biomedical engineering**, and more in the fields of STEM. I also play soccer ([follow ladies of fall!](https://www.instagram.com/ladiesoffall/?hl=en)) and softball and love to play the guitar. Otherwise, I'm involved in Feminist Forum, Young Women's Professional Networking Group, SAGA, **Jazz Band**, and more. 
- 📫 In this class, I'd mainly like to continure to build my skills in Python because I know how important it is in college CS and beyond. After participating in a datascience course this summer, **GSTEM**, I learned how valuable skills in DS and python are and would like to learn more about powerful manipulations and representations of data.
